		a 23-year-old fellow who has a brutally bright future ahead of him.

		Honing his skills as an apprentice to comic book legend Paul Chadwick, Ford
		currently does amazing album covers, posters, and flyers for bands such as
		Thrones, Black Elk, Baroness, and many other metal-oriented acts. His
		impossibly detailed and expressive work lends itself perfectly to the music
		of the bands he works with. [Gerry Mak]

	<h1> About the artist </h1>
	<p><img class="pull-left img-responsive" src="../images/sam.jpg">
	Sam Ford is an illustrator, visual artist and musician operating out of Los
	Angeles by way of Portland, OR.  He has worked since 2005 creating album
	covers, logos, merchandise, and show flyers for local, national and
	international acts, as well as designing tattoos, murals, and comic
	illustration, all while playing drums and singing in the band Wizard Rifle.
	He was born in San Francisco, raised to the age of 5 in the redwoods of Humboldt County,
then lived until 18 years old on San Juan Island in Washington State.
It was here that legendary artist, writer and comic industry
veteran Paul Chadwick took Sam on as an apprentice for nearly six years and
lent his limitless talent and wisdom (and patience) to passing on the art of
illustration and storytelling.
</p><p>
In 2005 Sam moved to Portland Oregon, became part of the thriving and diverse
 music scene there, and spent the better part of the next 5 years doing work for
	local and touring bands, in particular those aligned with the
 heavier and darker side of music.</p><p>
 With the help of many great and supportive friends over the years, such as
 frequent collaborator Nate Carson of Witch Mountain and Nanotear Booking,
 Sam has managed to create a large body of work covering many different styles and
 media for an ever-growing range of clients.</p><p>
 Sam has exhibited both original and commissioned works at the Hive Gallery
 in downtown Los Angeles (http://hivegallery.com/2010/), as well as galleries
 in NYC and Portland.</p>
